# DaTscan-image-analysis
Adaptation of tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/input_data.py  from the Google TensorFlow repository for DaTscan image analysis

Evaluation of dopamine transporter integrity in Parkinson's disease is the basis of functional neuroimaging studies such as DaTscan SPECT. DaTscan imaging studies are available in the DICOM file format, the standard format for medical imaging. This repository contains a modification of input_data.py from the TensorFlow MNIST tutorial such that raw DaTscan DICOM images can be submitted to TensorFlow to implement machine learning models for automated image classification.
